performance


+ debug nondeterminism with movefinder
+ debug slow performance on first iteration



+ try building a starting set of move finder
+ carry movefinder cache between calls

next thing to try
+ run current code on other move finder

Sad days
+ Run each particle as an aws batch job
  - doesnt work well at all
