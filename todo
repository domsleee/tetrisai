Todo

Things to try
+ Train using MoveFinderFSM (will probably take forever)
+ Train with new TETRIS_READY

Functional improvements
+ Fix move ordering (prioritise least moves + least taps)
+ One-piece lookahead in evaluation
+ setup CI
+ feature vector: type safety & ease of accessing new features

Performance improvements
+ Use normal MoveFinder (web)
+ consider using threading (web)












TODAY

+ setup level 18 AI & run

Blocked
+ level 18 takes 567 to run one particle (100 games @ 150)
+ 5 seconds for one game at 150 lines (crazy, expect 0.33)



performance
+ use boost.python

ideas
+ use 18/19 transition logic
+ move penalty logic to instant failure

future features
+ micro-optimisation with next piece lookahead
+ quick-tap
