Maybe important:
* There is a frame lag on registering buttons. For example, if you hold down LEFT after frame 555 is rendered, it will not be shown until 557.
  - You can press LEFT the frame before the piece appears (after the frame before the piece appears), and it will be applied the frame after the piece appears (i.e. 2 frames later)
* For developing MoveFinderFSM: With JSNES, you cannot press two buttons at the same time (e.g. move and rotate). Only the first will be registered
* When holding DAS, the piece will be moved on the SECOND frame, not the first.

Not important
* When you get a tetris and the screen flashes, it flashes every 4 frames (for one frame). Despite being flashed for only one frame, the pixels are affected for 2 frames.
